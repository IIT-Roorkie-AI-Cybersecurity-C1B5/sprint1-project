# Sprint1-project -— Security Control Mapping

Repository for IIT Roorkie Ai Cybersecurity Batch 5 - Sprint 1


## Project Title
**Network Security Controls: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Network Segmentation, VPNs, and Traffic Monitoring**

## Team
- **P1 :**  Poojan Patel
- **P2:**  Shilpa Soni
- **P3:**  Megha Sharma
- **P4:**  Vishnoo Rath

## Problem Statement
Modern organizations face constant cyber threats such as malware, ransomware, unauthorized access, and lateral movement inside networks.  
This project explains and maps key **Network Security Controls** that protect enterprise networks, focusing on:
- Firewalls (NGFW)
- IDS/IPS
- Network Segmentation
- VPN (Remote Access & Site-to-Site)
- Traffic Monitoring (NetFlow/PCAP/SIEM)

## Objectives
- Explain how each network security control works and where it is placed in an enterprise network.
- Provide practical implementation guidance and common misconfigurations.
- Map the controls to security frameworks and produce a unified control catalog.
- Define monitoring strategy and KPIs to ensure continuous compliance and effectiveness.

## Scope
### Included
- Perimeter + internal network protection controls
- Detection + prevention controls (IDS/IPS)
- Segmentation techniques (VLAN/ACL/Microsegmentation)
- Secure remote access controls (VPN + MFA recommendations)
- Traffic visibility and monitoring strategy (logs, flows, alerts)

### Excluded
- Endpoint security (EDR/AV)
- Application security (WAF, SAST/DAST)
- Physical security
- Deep incident response playbooks (only workflow linkage)

## Enterprise Scenario (Example)
A mid-sized organization with:
- Internet-facing services in a DMZ
- Internal departments separated into network zones
- Remote users accessing via VPN
- Central logging + monitoring through SIEM
